# Python Examples and PoCs

This repository is my personal space for **Python exercises** and learning projects.  

The main purpose is to:  
- Upload exercises I complete while learning Python on my own, following books, courses, and challenges.  
- Store **small PoCs** (Proof of Concepts) or experiments I develop in the future.  
- Keep a place to document and share things I find interesting or fun in Python.  

## Structure

- `exercises/` → Folder with Python exercises and practice scripts.  
- `pocs/` → Folder for experiments, mini projects, or PoCs.  
- `README.md` → This file, describing the repository.  

> Note: This repository is constantly evolving, so you will find new content as I progress in my learning and personal projects.
